// Basic Information:
name        = "User Engine File";
description = "This cognitive engine is designed to be updated by a user or program while CRTS is running.";

// The point of this file is to allow a person or external program to control the Tx parameters of CRTS, rather
// than one of the the internal CRTS engines.

// This cognitive engine is designed to be updated by a user or program while CRTS is running.
// If the 'adaptationCondition' option is set to "user_specified", CRTS will read the CE config file with
// the name "userEngine.txt" every cognition cycle, and it will update every option that is listed in the file.

// To change an option, simply replace the current setting with a different one and CRTS will
// update accordingly on the next pass.

// For example, to change the modulation scheme from 64PSK to 16PSK, simply replace the line
//     modScheme           =   "64PSK";
// with
//     modScheme           =   "16PSK";

// NOTE: It is very important not to ever change the 'adaptationCondition' option. It must remain
// set to "user_specified" for CRTS to continue reading this file, rather than revert to
// an internal CE.
